# Leveraging-Machine-Learning-For-Cardiac-Attack-Prediction
Abstract:
The project endeavors to create a sophisticated software solution facilitating
 seamless connectivity between patients and doctors worldwide. This initiative aims
 to develop an advanced software solution that enables seamless communication
 between patients and healthcare providers globally. The primary objective of this
 project is to utilize machine learning techniques, particularly a refined Random
 Forest algorithm, to predict the likelihood of cardiac events using the healthcare
dataset-stroke-data.
 This dataset encompasses critical health-related variables,
 including age, gender, history of hypertension, heart disease, average glucose levels,
 body mass index , smoking habits, and employment type, all of which are essential
 for evaluating a patient’s cardiac risk. Initially, the data undergoes preprocessing
 to address missing values, encode categorical variables, scale numerical features,
 and select the most pertinent attributes based on their correlation and significance.
 The Random Forest classifier is selected due to its superior accuracy and capability
 to manage intricate, non-linear data, and it is meticulously fine-tuned to enhance
 hyperparameters such as the number of decision trees and the depth of the trees. The
 f
 inal optimized model achieves an accuracy rate of 96. To illustrate its practical
 application, the model is incorporated into a straightforward web application
 developed with Flask, enabling users to enter patient information and receive
 prompt cardiac risk assessments.A machine learning based method for predicting
 heart attacks utilizing a tuned Random Forest algorithm. The model is developed
 using an extensive dataset that includes significant clinical features such as age,
 blood pressure, cholesterol levels, ECG findings, and heart rate. Hyperparameter
 tuning strategies, such as grid search and cross-validation, are used to enhance
 the model’s performance, demonstrating high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
score, exceeding that of standard baseline models.This project exemplifies how
 machine learning, when effectively calibrated and applied to authentic healthcare
 data, can facilitate early detection and potentially save lives through timely medical
 intervention
